Jokes REST API - Test Task Showcase
üéØ Overview
This repository houses a simple yet effective Jokes REST API, developed as a test task to demonstrate my skills in building RESTful services with Java and Spring Boot. It emphasizes clean code, robust testing, and a practical approach to API design. This project highlights my ability to deliver high-quality, maintainable code under realistic constraints.

‚ú® Key Features
RESTful API Design: Adheres to REST principles for clear and concise data access.

Spring Boot: Leverages the power of Spring Boot for rapid application development.

In-Memory Data: Uses an in-memory data store (for simplicity in a test task scenario).

Unit Testing: Includes comprehensive unit tests to ensure code reliability.

Clean and Readable Code: Focuses on code clarity and maintainability.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
Java: Core language for building the application.

Spring Boot: Framework for streamlined development and dependency management.

Maven: Build automation tool.

JUnit: Testing framework for unit tests.

üöÄ Get Started
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/YaroslavPiskachov/jokes.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
cd jokes
Run the application using Maven:

bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Access the API:

The API will be available at http://localhost:8080.

üìö API Endpoints
GET /jokes: Retrieves a list of jokes.

GET /jokes/{id}: Retrieves a specific joke by its ID.

‚úÖ Testing
To execute the unit tests, run the following command:

bash
./mvnw test
This will ensure that all tests pass and the application functions as expected.

‚ûï Future Improvements
Persistence: Integrate a persistent data store (e.g., H2, PostgreSQL) for data persistence.

Exception Handling: Implement more robust exception handling and error responses.

Validation: Add request validation to ensure data integrity.

API Documentation: Generate API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI.
